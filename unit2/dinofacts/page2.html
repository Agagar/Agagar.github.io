 <p>Diet: carnivorous</p>
 <p>Teeth: lots of sharp, pointed teeth</p>

  <p>As portrayed in the Jurassic Park movies, the Velociraptor was recreated at twice its actual size and closely modelled on Deinonychus. Though this was seen as unscientific at the time, soon after the first film was released, a dinosaur of the same type, the Utahraptor, was discovered, even larger than the virtual Velociraptors.</p>
  <p>The Velociraptor is now thought to have had a fine feather-like covering.</p>
