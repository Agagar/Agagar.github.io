  <li><a href="unit2/dinofacts/page1.html">&#124;Majungasaurus Facts:</a></li>
    <p>I Decovered the Majungasaurus in the mobile game Jurassic World the game. At first I thought it was a Tyrannasaurus, but with further inspection I learned it was, well a Majungasaurus. Then I started looking for facts about it and I found out that its jaw was more for holding and thrashing its prey then using it for chomping.</p>
  <li><a href="unit2/dinofacts/page2.html">&#124;Velociraptor Facts:</a></li>
    <p>I descovered the Velociraptor in the Jurassic park movie, I thought they were scary at first, but when I watched them in Jurassic Park lost world and Jurassic Park III. I was facinated by them and wanted to know more about them, I was disappointed to figure out that they were smaller, but I got use to it. Now their just like cute little Gremlins that could kill a growned adult.</p>
  <li><a href="unit2/dinofacts/page3.html">&#124;Spinosaurus Facts:</a></li>
    <p>When I saw Jurassic Park III I thought it was so cool. My favorit part was when the Spinosaurus fought the Tyrannasaurus and won, it was a awesome fight. So I new instantly I wanted to learn more about this creature. I would look for videos of them fighting and interviews about the Spinosaurus to learn as much as I can of it.</p>
